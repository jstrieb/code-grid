- Bugs
  - Cannot select on mobile
    - Is this necessary to fix?
  - Scrolling up or left with selection doesn't work, scrolling down and right
    only kind of works
    - Will be fixed automatically when lazy scrolling
  - Dialog X button is not square
    - `<Button>` square attribute doesn't work because the button is mounted
      with `display: none`, and therefore has zero width and height at mount
      time
    - Using `<Button>` has too much shadow
  - Context menu does not activate on iOS
    - Manually have to detect long press
  - The bottom border of sheet tabs do not adjust after renaming
