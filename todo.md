    only kind of works
    - Will be fixed automatically when lazy scrolling

    - Manually have to detect long press
  - The bottom border of sheet tabs do not adjust after renaming
    - Will be fixed automatically when using windows instead of tabs
  - If all sheets are deleted, it glitches
  - Reference value changes re-run, but argument function calls to set don't
    force re-run
  - history.pushstate with non-cloneable values fails
  - For very long text, the formula bar text is fully blocked by the scroll bar
    on Windows
  - Copy/paste does not always work
  - Line numbers have small lag on scroll
